    "The energies of electronic excited states prove, in general, challenging to compute. Excited states are usually more entangled than ground states and so require more computational resources to compute. This causes the number of states considered in a calculation to grow considerably, often beyond the capabilities of the most advanced classical supercomputers. This is a problem as it makes classical computation of the energy, to an appropriate accuracy, of many molecules impossible. Quantum computers are inherently capable of handling calculations with entangled states and can provide a workable solution.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates calculation of excited states of molecules using quantum algorithms. This has recently been achieved by IBM with efficient circuit designs using exchange-type gates.[1] \n",
    "\n",
    "However this example shows Qiskit Aqua interface combined with fast circuit compilation and optimization via `t|ket〉`.  It makes use of the Quantum Subspace Expansion [2, 3] as implemented in `pytket` (the python interface to `t|ket〉`). To install it go to http://github.com/CQCL/pytket and follow the README (or just try running `pip install pytket`).\n",

    "In order to perform this calculation, we start from a ground state wavefunction $\\Psi_0$ calculated with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) technique. We construct a subspace of state vectors $\\Psi_i^k$ formed by one-electron excitations of the ground state wavefunction:\n",

In a similar fashion, the H matrix elements can be measured after constructing the operator $c_ic_k^\\dagger \\hat{H}c_l^\\dagger c_j$, transforming it to a representation of Pauli operators and applying it over $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$. \n",

The calculation also finds a number of excited states. Looking at the first three of these, we find that at the equilibrium distance, these states are 0.11, 0.12 and 0.17 Ha higher in energy than the ground state, which is again in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Note the small kink in one of the excited states energy curve at a distance of approximately 1.2 Å. This indicates that our restriction to single electron excitations is not enough to provide an accurate description at this distance.
