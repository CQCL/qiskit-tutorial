    "## Quantum chemistry in the NISQ era, and the need for circuit optimization techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the expected applications of noisy, intemediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is simulating quantum chemistry. In its simplest form, a quantum chemisty calculation answers the question \"Given how electrons and nuclei of a particular molecule are arranged, what is the _energy_ of that configuration?\". By examining how the energy of the configuration changes as the nuclei and electrons are moved relative to one another, we can map out an _energy surface_. The configuration that minimizes the energy is a stable, equilibrium point for the molecule. Knowing this configuration (and its associated energy), we can deduce a variety of molecular properties, including **NEED EXAMPLES**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most quantum chemistry algorithms for computing moleecular energies rely on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm **CITATION NEEDED**. This algorithm uses a parameterized _ansatz_ $|{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle$ to describe the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian $H$ for a given configuration. By examining how the expected energy $\\langle \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})|H| \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle$ changes as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is varied, we can optimize the parameters to find an estimate for the ground state and its corresponding energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the VQE algorithm on actual hardware has two complications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficiently preparing the trial state $|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficiently measuring the terms in the Hamiltonian $H$ that describe the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll focus on the problem of efficiently preparing the trial state. We do so for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An accurate estimate of the ground state is all that's necessary to do the quantum subspace expansion technique to estimate excited state energies\n",
    "\n",
    "* To demonstrate the capabilies of Qiskit `Terra` and CQC's `t|ket>` compiler to reduce the circuit _resources_ (number of gates, depth, etc.) for the state preparation. In principle, these capabilities can be deployed for other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing the resources is crucial in the NISQ era, because NISQ devices cannot execute arbitrarily-sized circuits. (Here, \"size\" refers to the **INFORMATION NEEDED** of the circuit, which is a **XXXXX**.) For this reason, techniques which reduce circuit requirements are necessary to obtain accurate results on real hardware. Note that there are techniques, such as qubit tapering **CITATION**, or the manual construction of efficient circuit designs **IBM [1] citation** which also reduce circuit resources. However, those techniqeus reduce resources at the elvel of the Hamiltonian itself; here, we're interested in techniques that also reduce resources without having to reformulate the Hamiltonian. **TECHNICAL QUESTION: Do these techniques relate more to the second complication raised above?**\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, our approach utilizes Qiskit `Aqua` to generate a parameterized ansatz based on the _Unitary Coupled Cluster, Single-Double_ (UCCSD) ansatz **TODO: citation**. We then use Qiskit `Terra` and the `t|ket>` compiler (as implemented in `pytket`) to optimize the circuit for that ansatz. We will show that the optimized ansatz requires substantially fewer circuit resources than the naive UCCSD ansatz. An application of our approach, we show how to use the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) technique to compute excited state energies for gaseous hydrogen (H$_{2}$) and lithium hydride (LiH)."

    "The calculation provides a refined value of the ground state and a series of excited state energies, whose number depends on the size of the basis set chosen for the molecule, as well as its nature and symmetry. Some of the energies obtained are repeated several times, signaling that some of the states obtained are degenerate. This result can be improved by either increasing the basis set or considering higher-order excitations in the subspace expansion.\n",

    "Using our quantum algorithm, we find the ground state curve has a minimum at a separation of about 1.5 Å, which is in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The calculation also finds a number of excited states. Looking at the first three of these, we find that at the equilibrium distance, these states are 0.11, 0.12 and 0.17 Ha higher in energy than the ground state, which is again in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Note the small kink in one of the excited states energy curve at a distance of approximately 1.2 Å. This indicates that our restriction to single electron excitations is not enough to provide an accurate description at this distance. Overall, the comparison with classically computed EOM-CCSD curves shows that this method reproduces excited state energies with good accuracy at most distances.\n",
